   	The system is a web based Manufacturing System that enables a Manufacturing company to 
   	schedule its  manufacturing operations based on the daily update of sales from its dealers.
     The system is modeled to be used by a Manufacturing company, whose main activity is manufacturing 
    different products & then selling the finished goods through a network of Dealers.  
     The Stocks of all the Products manufactured by the company and held in  the company ware-house are 
     stored in a Database.The details that are stored include the quantity of each product held with the 
    company dealers who hold the stocks of finished products for sale.
    Once the sales figures of Products sold in the past week are entered by  the Dealers over the internet 
    along with the Orders for the next delivery, the schedule for the next week’s production will be drawn up. 
    A report of the required raw materials or parts will be drawn up with   the approved suppliers for each & 
    the suppliers will be intimated about the part requirements over the internet & asked to quote their rates. 
    The message asking for a Quotation will be sent as an e-mail message. 
    Once the rates are quoted, the Order will be placed with the required delivery schedules.  
     The system incorporates intelligent Order processing System which checks and intimates the required 
     Higher-ups in the Company about any discrepancies in the Orders that were placed. 
    For example if an Order is placed with a Supplier whose rates are not  the least then an automatic 
    Event-generation will send the details of the Order & the person who placed it to the Managers or 
    Directors who are supposed to oversee the process.
